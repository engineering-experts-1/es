      With almost 40 years experience as a safety regulator, consultant, and engineer, Mr. Elveston has investigated a wide range of worksites from logging operations to major construction to several of the most costly chemical plant/refinery explosions in the world. Major investigations included the '89 Phillips 66 explosion, the '90 ARCO explosion, and the '05 BP explosion.<br><br>
      As a safety engineer/compliance officer with OSHA for almost 30 years, Mr. Elveston prepared prima facie cases for over 2500 inspections/investigations. The knowledge and experience gained, not only from the investigations during this period, but also of the regulatory requirements, their application, and their enforcement by the federal agency provided the basis for a second career as a forensic engineer providing expert testimony to law firms pursuing legal actions related to incidents involving federal safety laws and regulations.<br><br>
      Following his retirement from OSHA in January of 2007, Mr. Elveston established his engineering firm to provide litigation support to law firms including consultation, on-site investigation, research, report preparation, and testimony at deposition and trial. While his primary area of expertise is petrochemicals and the related regulations, his extensive background has enabled him to perform successfully in the broad range of OSHA's jurisdiction, including construction, maritime, oil & gas, manufacturing, and general industry.<br><br>
